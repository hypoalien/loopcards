## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Ready to upgrade your networking game? With Loopcards, it's as simple as tap, connect, and go! After signing up and creating your profile packed with all your essential info and social links, you're all set to make connections.

But here's where it gets exciting – load your profile URL onto any NFC-enabled card, such as the popular NXP NTAG series, and you're ready to start networking on the fly! Whether you're at a conference, a coffee shop, or a networking event, simply tap your card on any compatible device, and watch as your profile magically appears.

Loopcards isn't just about convenience – it's about making networking sustainable too. By ditching traditional paper business cards, we're reducing waste and doing our part for the environment.

Join us on this journey of innovation and collaboration! Loopcards is more than just a networking tool; it's a community-driven project where your ideas and feedback matter. Let's revolutionize networking together, one tap at a time!
